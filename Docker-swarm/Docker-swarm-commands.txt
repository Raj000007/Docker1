1. To make the docker host manager node 
--> docker swarm init 
     when you type the command you will get the token in the manager docker host copy that token and paste it in slave node 

2. To add the worker to the docker swarm 
    Example:
    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-267sejn9if5uxoo18cryrxt8w4vq4bssv5amrbf5mdb7oouf97-cuach5ow4j4lqozyxevt18wsm 172.31.44.159:2377

3. To see the nodes in the docker swarm
--> docker node ls
     Note: This command should be enter in manager node 

4. If the slave need to leave from the docker swarm cluster 
--> docker swarm leave 
     Note: This command should be enter in slave node 

5. If you want to remove the node from docker swarm cluster 
--> docker node rm <node_id>

6. If you want the token to add node to cluster 
--> docker swarm join-toker worker
     Note: This should be entered in manager node

7. To create the service in the manager 
--> docker service create --name <service_name> --replicas <number of replicas> --publish <port_number> <image_name>

8. To see the services running
--> docker service ls
     Note: This command should be enter in manager node

9. To remove the services from the docker swarm
--> docker service rm <service_name>
